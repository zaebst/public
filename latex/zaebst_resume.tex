\affiliation[Unix/Linux Systems Administrator]
            {Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation}
            {June 2011-August 2012}

\begin{compactitem}

\item  Administered Red Hat and AIX severs used for transaction processing and fraud detection software.
\item  Coordinated with internal database, networking, and security teams, along with external product vendors to install new applications.
\item  Developed Perl libraries as CPAN style modules and packaged modules in RPM format.  Libraries were designed to lookup the user id specific to an application and environment, initialize the shell environment, and launch processes as daemons. 
\item  Troubleshot issues in a complex environment including Centrify authentication, MQ, MQFTE, Maestro, WebSphere, TSM, ETL, Oracle RAC, and vendor applications.
\item  Managed creation of new users, groups, and setup ssh key infrastructure.
\item  Maintained and updated the proprietary build system.  Managed promotion of code from development to production using a centralized source control server. 
\item  Reduced application start time for the deposit processing server from 27 minutes to 6 minutes by launching processes in parallel.
\item  Automated application verification procedures that were manually run by operations.  The results were automatically sent in an email report to operations and the application specific team.  
\item  Investigated issues with vendor applications written in C, C++, and Java.  Liaised with vendors to resolve issues with products.  
\item  Utilized common diagnostic tools such as strace, trace, gdb, pstree, lsof, wireshark, and netstat.   
\item  Patched applications and setup environments for user acceptance tests.

            {Morgan Stanley}
            {August 2009-February 2011}

\begin{compactitem}

\item	Maintained and supported seven trading applications with Linux backends and Windows frontends.
\item   Took ownership of technical and trading issues.  Prioritized multiple issues, managed expectations, and ensured resolution.
\item   Troubleshot applications and investigated complaints to determine their root cause from database slowness, network latency, and application logic flaws.
\item   Worked with Sybase stored procedures and Perl to generate trader entitlement reports in excel format.  Utilized LDAP to check departments against expected entitlements.
\item	Added workflows to the in house application setup system.  The system had a web interface and stored workflows in databases.  Each workflow ran a set of functions to automate the installation and configuration of an application.
\item   Utilized Perl DBI to update trading application configurations and financial product information stored in Sybase.  
\item   Reconciled financial product records by comparing vendor supplied tables to application tables.  The program added default configurations to new products and removed old products prior to daily process caching.
\item	Repaired and developed reports in SQL that displayed summaries of trade executions and commission earnings.  Setup user groups to receive reports and scheduled their runtimes with autosys. 
\item   Enhanced server and application monitoring using proprietary publisher-subscriber libraries.
\item   Built a trade re-reporting tool to query published alerts and resubmit trade reports with needed modifications.
\item   Created command line tools to query multiple trading processes and aggregate order information.  Included functions to cancel specific orders.

\item 	Wrote C and C++ test code for libraries using CUnit and CppUnit.   
\item	Installed Cruise Control for continuous integration. Generated configuration XML and Apache Ant files to work with proprietary software build system.
\item	Designed internal web pages with CGI, AJAX, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for Apache servers.  The pages displayed holiday date changes, and provided documentation.  
\item   Created Perl programs to check FTP feeds for vendor-supplied financial calendars, download data, and convert the data to internal format.  
\item	Supported source code control and builds for the fixed income department with proprietary code, CMake, GMake, ClearCase, and SVN.
